            In 2027, in a chaotic world in which women have somehow become infertile, a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea.

In the dystopian world of 2027 London, humans have been incapable of reproducing for 18 year for an unknown reason, meaning the imminent extinction of the species. Britain is the one remaining civilized society on the planet, which has resulted in people wanting to migrate there, so it has become a police state to handle the immigrants, who are placed into refugee camps. Lowly government bureaucrat Theo Faron, once an activist, is approached by the Fishes, deemed a terrorist group, led by his ex-wife Julian Taylor, whom he hasn't seen in almost 20 years, since their marriage disintegrated after their infant son Dylan's death during the 2008 flu pandemic. Although the Fishes did use terrorist means in their on-going revolution against the state in the fight for immigrant rights, Julian vows that they now garner support solely by speaking to the people, and she wants Theo to use his connections to get transit papers for a young immigrant woman named Kee who needs to get to the coast. Although initially reluctant to do it because of the difficulty, Theo is able to grant Julian this favor, however with the change that he now needs to accompany Kee on her journey. As Theo and Kee progress on that journey, Theo learns more and more about what's going on, including the reason that Kee needs to get to the coast, the fact that no one in the group knows if their end destination even exists, and that his and Kee's lives are in greater danger than he believed when they started the journey. But Theo's sole mission becomes to help Kee at any cost for the survival of the species.

        <h2 class="section-header"> Cinematography Breakdown:  </h2>
        <p>
             Over the years, there have been long debates on who is the best duo of film director/cinematographer of all time. During Hollywood’s golden era, 
            the names that have come up were Alfred Hitchcock/Robert Burks, Ingmar Bergman/Sven Nykvist, and David Lean/Freddie Young.
            Today is a lot more different. Whenever people think of the best duo of film director/DP, they think of Steven Spielberg/Janusz Kaminski, 
            Christopher Nolan/Wally Pfister, Spike Lee/Ernest Dickerson, and possibly the most famous of them all, the Cohen Brothers/Roger Deakins.
             Those collaborations show the best working relationship between the director and cinematographer. The duo of Alfonso Curon and Emanuel Lubezki is no exception.
            Curon and Lubezki have made some of my favorite films of all time. I loved Gravity and Y Tu Mamá También. I even adore Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,
             the third installment of the Harry Potter franchise. Today we are going to be covering Children of Men. Some of the clips in this article may contain material not suitable for young readers. Viewer discretion is advised.
